# Game Explanation

This experiment features a **coordination game**. You will play multiple rounds of this game.

Game rounds:
- Each round has two players (you and another participant). Both players will be given two options to choose between.
- If both players choose the same option, you both win points. If you choose different options, neither player wins points.
- At the end of the experiment, your points will be totalled and added to your final payment.
